To provide a scala client API for Api provided by Apigee with Source feature.


How to run: sourcecodesample.scala.ScalaSourceSample is the Example launcher which contains some commands to execute
the below apis. Run it with the classpath of scala + thirdpartlibs

Apigee Provides the following REST APIs to help build an application:

1. Create Application - This is the end point to create a developer application resource.
This would assign a name to the application and associate it to the owner,who should be an
Apigee User.

Example: createApp <app_name> <app_owner> <app_owner_pwd>
where <app_name> is the name of the application you would like to assign
      <app_owner> is the application owner name ,who also should be an Apigee user before trying this.
	  <app_owner_pwd> is the owner's apigee password.
	  
2. Configure the Application with the target provider. This assigns the application crendetials for this
provider - like consumer key,secret which would be generated by the target provider when the owner 
would have registered his application with target provider in the first place.

Example: configureProvider <app_name> <app_owner> <app_owner_pwd> <provider> <auth_type> <consumer_key> <consumer_secret>
where <app_name> is the name of the application 
      <app_owner> is the application owner name ,who also should be an Apigee user before trying this.
	  <app_owner_pwd> is the owner's apigee password.
	  <provider> is the provider name like twitter - as of now,this provider should already be one of the provider exposed by Apigee Console.
	  <auth_type> is the authentication protocol to use - like oauth1,oauth2.
	  <consumer_key> is the consumer key obtained when the application would have been registered. 
	  <consumer_secret> is the consumer secret obtained when the application would have been registered.
	  
3. Create Application (end) user - this creates a user for this application. 	  
Example: createAppUser <app_name> <app_owner> <app_owner_pwd>  <provider>  <app_user> <app_user_pwd>
where <app_name> is the name of the application 
      <app_owner> is the application owner name ,who also should be an Apigee user before trying this.
	  <app_owner_pwd> is the owner's apigee password.
	  <provider> is the provider name like twitter - as of now,this provider should already be one of the provider exposed by Apigee Console.
	  <app_user> is the name of the user 
	  <app_user_pwd> is the user's password

4. Finally, An api to make provider request.
Example: makeRequest <app_name>  <provider> <http_verb> <path> <user_smart_key>
where <app_name> is the name of the application 
	   <provider> is the target provider -  as of now,this provider should already be one of the provider exposed by Apigee Console.
	   <http_verb> like get,post etc
	   <path> like /1/statuses/home_timeline.xml
	   <user_smart_key> - the identifer of the end user obtained during add user.
